# OpenIndex Manifesto

## 1. Why OpenIndex Exists

Knowledge deserves to be discoverable without permission.

In the digital age, the act of publishing no longer requires presses, warehouses, or centralized gatekeepers. Yet the systems we use to **identify, catalog, and reference published works** still depend on closed registries, artificial scarcity, and fee-based access.

OpenIndex exists to offer a different path.

OpenIndex is an **open, web-native index for identifying published works**—built for a world where creation is abundant, distribution is global, and access to knowledge should not be constrained by rent-seeking infrastructure.

----------

## 2. What OpenIndex Is

OpenIndex is:

-   An **open registry**, not a proprietor

-   A **lookup system**, not an authority

-   A **coordination layer**, not a gatekeeper


OpenIndex provides a simple promise:

> Any published work can be identified by a persistent, resolvable web address—free to create, open to verify, and durable over time.

An OpenIndex identifier is not a license, not a claim of ownership, and not a judgment of value. It is a **reference**—nothing more, nothing less.

----------

## 3. What OpenIndex Is Not

OpenIndex is not:

-   A replacement for ISBN, DOI, or existing systems

-   A paywall for participation

-   A centralized authority over publishing

-   A platform that monetizes identity

-   A mechanism for exclusion or control


OpenIndex does not decide what is “official,” “valid,” or “worthy.”  
It exists to make works **findable**, not to grant legitimacy.

----------

## 4. The Web Is the Registry

The web already solves the hardest problems of identification:

-   Global uniqueness (DNS)

-   Resolution (HTTPS)

-   Persistence (archival tooling)

-   Interoperability (open standards)


OpenIndex builds on this foundation instead of reinventing it.

Every OpenIndex identifier is a **URL**.  
Every identifier resolves to **open metadata**.  
Every system that understands the web already understands OpenIndex.

----------

## 5. Publisher and Creator Sovereignty

Creators and publishers retain control over their work.

OpenIndex identifiers:

-   Do not transfer rights

-   Do not impose licenses

-   Do not restrict distribution


Namespaces exist to prevent collisions—not to establish hierarchy.

No entity owns the identity of a work.

----------

## 6. Openness as a Structural Commitment

Openness is not a marketing term. It is a constraint.

OpenIndex commits to:

-   An open specification

-   Open-source reference implementations

-   Transparent governance

-   Public change processes

-   No fees for creating identifiers


Any system that cannot be freely implemented is not truly open.

----------

## 7. Persistence Over Profit

Identifiers must outlive organizations.

OpenIndex prioritizes:

-   Stability over speed

-   Compatibility over novelty

-   Longevity over monetization


Revenue may exist at the edges—through services, tools, or support—but **identity itself must remain free**.

When identity becomes a product, knowledge becomes a hostage.

----------

## 8. Interoperability Over Dominance

OpenIndex is designed to coexist.

It may reference:

-   ISBNs

-   DOIs

-   Library identifiers

-   Internal catalog numbers


Interoperability is a feature, not a compromise.

The goal is not to win, but to **connect**.

----------

## 9. Minimalism as a Principle

Complexity creates fragility.

OpenIndex seeks the smallest possible system that can work:

-   Simple identifiers

-   Minimal required metadata

-   Clear resolution behavior

-   Predictable rules


Everything else is optional, layered, and replaceable.

----------

## 10. Governance in the Open

Trust requires visibility.

OpenIndex governance will be:

-   Public

-   Documented

-   Forkable


No private ownership of the standard.  
No silent changes.  
No closed decision-making.

If trust is lost, the system has failed.

----------

## 11. A Commitment to the Long Term

OpenIndex is built for decades, not funding cycles.

It is designed for:

-   Libraries yet to be built

-   Works yet to be written

-   Tools yet to be imagined


We believe that the quiet infrastructure of knowledge matters—and that it should belong to everyone.

----------

## 12. An Invitation

OpenIndex is not complete.

It is an invitation:

-   To publishers seeking alternatives

-   To librarians seeking openness

-   To developers seeking simplicity

-   To educators, archivists, and readers


Participation does not require permission.

Only care.
